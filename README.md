As my first project for the Justice Through Code program I have developed a tip calculator with python. 

The calculator starts by taking in basic information from the user including the subtotal of the bill and the number of people in the party that will be splitting the bill. It will than ask the user what % tip they would like to leave, calculates the total and returns the amount each person will need to contibute. 

Once the calculator has told each person what they owe it will ask the user if they would like to calculate a different tip. If the user responds yes, the calculor will ask them what the new tip will be and return a total for each person. This process will continue until the user anwsers no to calculating a new tip.
